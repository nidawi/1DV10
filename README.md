# Assignment 4 - 1DV610

## Comment about the commit history
Unfortunately, after having finished yet another one of my 18+ hour work sessions at 7 am I accidentally managed to push some things that shouldn't be on git.
Since git is... not the best service in the world, you cannot just casually walk in a fix an issue but instead you have to nuke the whole god damned branch to fix
one little issue. So instead of my nice 10+ commit history, you will be stuck with this... much smaller one and with no recollection of how this came to be.
I am sorry about that.
